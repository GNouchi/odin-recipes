<p>Directions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Salt Salmon 1/2 hr to 24 hrs ahead of time and leave uncovered in fridge to dry brine</li>
    <li>Temp Salmon while oven is preheating to 500 or Broil setting. (This means bring it out of fridge 1/2 hr or 1 hr early so the meat fibers can relax to room temp and don't seize up when put into extreme heat of the oven.</li>
    <li>Spritz the salmon lightly with lemon juice, zest is fine too.</li>
    <li>Put Salmon skin-side up on sheet tray under broiler for 3-10 minutes and watch carefully, light charring is good and likely to occur - if fish is charring too quickly try moving it down a rack away from the broiler flames.</li>
    <li>Once the salmon looks nice and charred visually it is usually done. Ideally the salmon will have rings of deep golden sear with a few charred bubbles on the skin side while keeping a light pink inside.</li>
    <li>Grate Daikon and add a squeeze of lemon to it</li>
    <li>Serve with Rice and ponzu or Shoyu for the Daikon</li>
</ol>
